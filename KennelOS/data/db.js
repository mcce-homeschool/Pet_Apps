// Layering rule (see CLAUDE.md): pages never import this file directly and never
// call db.<table>.* — they go through the repo modules in /data. The repos are the
// only code that touches Dexie.
//
// Dexie is vendored locally (no CDN) so the app works offline after first load.
import Dexie from '../vendor/dexie.min.mjs';

// App-specific DB name: project pages on github.io share one origin as path
// prefixes, so a distinct name prevents collisions with anything else the user
// hosts on the same account (Data Model doc §2.1).
export const db = new Dexie('KennelOSBreedingApp');

// --- Schema ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Data Model Architecture Proposal v3 §2 collapses the version ladder into a
// SINGLE version(1) block covering all ten tables. That ladder only exists to
// protect real-data migrations, and nothing has shipped — there is no live data
// to migrate, so this is a deliberate, documented reset. The NEXT `.version(2)` block
// should be added only at the first real release; from then on, additive
// versioning applies as Dexie expects and this block is never edited again.
//
// Index notes:
//  - events '[subject_type+subject_id]' is a COMPOUND index, required for fast
//    "timeline for this dog/pairing/litter" lookups. Do not split into two.
//  - dogs '*co_owner_contact_ids' is a MULTI-ENTRY index so "dogs co-owned by X"
//    is a real query, not a full scan.
//  - Every canonical FK (Stage 4: sales/contracts/stud_services; Stage 4.5:
//    events.related_contact_id) is indexed, so every reverse lookup in
//    referenceRegistry.js is an index probe, never a scan.
//  - Only fields we actually query/filter on are indexed; all other fields still
//    persist, they just aren't indexed. `events.event_end_date` (Stage 4.5) is a
//    deliberate example: a plain nullable YYYY-MM-DD field, never queried/sorted
//    on directly, so it carries no index (Stage4.5 Addendum §C1).
//  - events '.reminder_date' (Stage 5, Build Brief §3.2) IS indexed: the reminder
//    engine's getReminders() range-probes it. This is the ONE index Stage 5 adds,
//    and the last one that gets to ride an edit to this collapsed version(1) block
//    (nothing has shipped — reconcile by Reset App + re-seed, no `.version(2)`).
//    Every further index after the first real release goes in an additive
//    `.version(2)` block that is never edited again (Build Brief §8).
//  - Stage 5 also adds two PLAIN fields — `events.reminder_dismissed` (boolean)
//    and `dogs.recorded_coi` (object) — that are deliberately UNindexed: they
//    persist and ride the JSON backup, but nothing queries them by key, so they
//    stay out of the index strings below (Build Brief §2.1/§3.2).
//  - `dogs.breeder_kennel_id` (FK → Kennel, the kennel that produced this dog —
//    distinct from `kennel_id`, which of the user's own kennels the dog belongs
//    to now) is indexed like every other canonical Dog FK, and guarded in
//    `KENNEL_REFERENCES` (referenceRegistry.js) so a Kennel can't be
//    hard-deleted out from under a dog that still names it as its breeder.
//  - `contracts.related_contact_id` (Companion feature) is the counterparty FK
//    for lease/co_own/other contracts — the types with no linked Sale/StudService
//    to reach a contact through. Indexed like every other canonical Contract FK
//    (so contractRepo.getByContact is an index probe) and guarded in
//    CONTACT_REFERENCES. Forced null for other types (contractRepo.normalizeLinks).
//  - `expenses` (Financials ledger) is the single home for money spent. It is
//    polymorphic like events — '[subject_type+subject_id]' compound index —
//    with subject_type ∈ {dog, litter, pairing, kennel}, so a cost can attach to
//    any of them (kennel-wide overhead lives on subject_type='kennel'). Its
//    `event_id` is the ONE canonical link between an event and its cost: a cost
//    entered on the event form is written here carrying the event's id, and the
//    event/timeline just query it back (expenseRepo.getByEvent) — Event no longer
//    stores a `cost` field. Indexed on event_id (fast "cost for this event"),
//    category (report filter), and expense_date (report range).
