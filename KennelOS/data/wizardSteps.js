// wizardSteps.js — the guided tour's ordered step catalog (Wizard Runtime Spec
// v1 §3). Hub order and in-hub order follow Tutorial_Coverage_Matrix_v1.md §F/§B;
// the per-stop teaching copy tracks the KennelOS Tour Guide (user-facing wording,
// plain text — cards render escaped, so no markdown/bullets/bold here). Data only,
// like vocab.js — no DOM, no logic. wizardState.js and wizardUI.js both import
// WIZARD_STEPS from here.
//
// Each step:
//   id         stable string id (never array position).
//   kind       'tour-intro' | 'hub-intro' | omitted (a "highlight" step). Intro
//              steps are centered, page-agnostic cards with a single forward
//              button (no Back/Next/Skip); highlight steps spotlight a real
//              element with Back/Next/Skip. The tour is: one tour-intro, then per
//              hub a hub-intro card followed by that hub's highlight steps.
//   button     (intro steps only) the single forward-button label.
//   hub        concise hub name; labels the hub-intro card for that hub.
//   page       bare page file (no path/query) — resolved to pages/<page> like
//              nav.js's HUB_CHILDREN. Detail pages carry a separate `anchor`.
//              Intro steps omit it — they render wherever the user currently is.
//   anchor     (detail pages only) a slug key into the seed's manifest.named
//              map (data/sampleData.js) — wizardUI.js resolves it to the
//              *current* seed's real id at runtime and builds `?id=<id>`. The
//              seed uses crypto.randomUUID() ids (not build-time constants), so
//              the link can only be resolved per-seed; manifest.named is the
//              map the seed writes for exactly this (spec §3.2, reconciled to
//              the actual seed).
//   selector   CSS selector for the coach-mark target on that page. Container
//              ids (`#…-section`, `[data-card="…"]`) are stable mount points
//              that always resolve; a step whose selector matches nothing
//              degrades to a centered tooltip (spec §4.3), never throws.
//   beforeShow { openCard: '<key>' } for ui.js cardShell cards (today/companion)
//              that may start collapsed — reuses the delegated card-toggle
//              listener. dog/litter/etc. sections default to expanded when the
//              seed populates them, so they need no reveal.
//   title/body one idea per stop, from the Tour Guide copy.
