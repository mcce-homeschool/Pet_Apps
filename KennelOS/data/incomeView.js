// income table: this module reads the Sale table and the outgoing StudService
// table (the only two places money-in is recorded) and normalizes each into one
// view-model row, classifying every money component as earned or anticipated.
// Same pattern awayBoard.js uses to union rows from two repos — a read-only
// aggregator over existing repos, storing nothing of its own (see §21).
//
// Why derived, not stored: revenue already lives on Sale.price/deposit_amount/
// transport_fee/deferred_boarding_amount and StudService.fee_amount. Duplicating
// it into an income table (or adding an `is_earned` flag) would be a stored
// back-pointer the architecture forbids — so earned/anticipated is COMPUTED here
// from status + which paid-date fields are filled, and recomputed on every load.
